# NeuralRecon-KD


## Changes made for NeuralRecon-Student

1. Within neuralrecon.py have renamed the class NeuralRecon to NeuralReconStudent
2. Within init.py renamed NeuralRecon to NeuralReconStudent as we have changed the class name there.
3. Within neucon_network.py have reduced the number of channels and also the number of layers within conv0 of Mnasnet to reduce the number of parameters.
